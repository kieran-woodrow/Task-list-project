# Task-list-project
This is a simple task list project that makes use of dynamic div creation and deletion, utilizing the DOM to add and remove tasks from the list as well as using local storage to save the changes made to the list. All the code is well commented, explaining the function and purpose of what each method and conditional statement does. The project is coded purely in vanilla javascript and HTML. I made use of 'Materialize', which is a modern responsive css framework which styled the task sheet.
The project has 2 files: 'index.html' and 'app.js'

# How to run
 Download all files and just open index.html
